# Make Tarkov Great Again

## Our Mission
`Make Tarkov Great Again` (MTGA) was established to revolutionize private server emulation for Escape From Tarkov. As open-source developers deeply embedded in modding communities, we recognized a critical gap: the lack of performant, adaptable alternatives to existing emulators. MTGA aims to empower players and modders alike through cutting-edge technology and modular server system.
