# Make Tarkov Great Again

*<p style="text-align:center;">Its going to be great, so great in fact, it will be the best.</p>*


## Our Mission  
**Make Tarkov Great Again (MTGA)** was established to revolutionize server emulation for *Escape From Tarkov*. As open-source developers deeply embedded in modding communities, we identified a critical need: high-performance, flexible alternatives to existing emulation frameworks.  

MTGA empowers players and modders by delivering a modular, Golang-based server. Our commitment lies in fostering creativity, enabling customization, and elevating the Tarkov experience beyond official limitations.
